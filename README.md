# vesting-contract

This contract is separated from the Blindex's protocol contracts as it's meant to be a contract to hold the code contributors/maintainers in a dedicated contract with a well-defined vesting system.

This makes sure Blindex will always have people helping push it forward and reach the community's goals.

Testing the change.

Blindex belongs to no one except its community.
